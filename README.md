# Tic Tac Toe font

The newest innovation in font technology, this bad boy packs ***594,936*** ligatures into one typeface!
12 MB of pure vectory goodness! Or, with the revolutionary technique of COMPRESSION (woff2), only *700 KB* (~18x ratio)

Compiling is very similar to my [Bad Apple Font](https://github.com/Mabi19/bad-apple-font), but you don't need to install opentype.js manually anymore!
You'll need make, bun, fontTools (for ttx), and python-brotli if you want to make a woff2 file.
Just run `make` (or `make tic-tac-toe.woff2` for the compressed version), and be prepared to wait a while. (About a minute on my Ryzen 9 7900X.)
